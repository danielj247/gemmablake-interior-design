Key Aesthetic Elements:
Color Palette: Predominantly neutral tones for a calming, high-end feel. Use soft beiges (#E5D9C7), light grays (#D3D3D3), whites (#FFFFFF) for backgrounds, and deeper accents like navy blue (#001F3F), warm browns (#8B4513), and subtle golds (#D4AF37) for highlights or calls-to-action. Avoid bright colors to maintain tranquility.
Typography: Elegant sans-serif fonts for body text (e.g., similar to Helvetica or Montserrat for readability and modernity) paired with subtle serif headings (e.g., akin to Playfair Display) to add a touch of classic sophistication. Font sizes: 16-18px for body, 32-48px for headers; line-height 1.5-1.8 for airy spacing.
Layout Structure: Minimalist and spacious, with a full-width hero section featuring high-quality imagery (e.g., interior photos or moodboards). Use a fixed navigation bar at the top with simple links (About, Services, Portfolio). Content sections in a grid or flexbox layout for portfolios, with generous white space (padding: 40-60px) and subtle animations on hover (e.g., scale 1.05 transitions). Responsive design is key—mobile-first with media queries for fluid scaling.
Imagery and Visuals: High-resolution photos of interiors, fabric swatches, and design elements in neutral schemes. Incorporate collages or moodboards showing textures (e.g., woven patterns, geometric motifs, leather). Images should be optimized (e.g., webp format) and placed in carousels or galleries with overlay captions.
Overall Vibe: Tranquil and premium, evoking artistry and passion for luxury design. Implement subtle layering effects (e.g., box-shadows for depth) and smooth scrolling. For interactivity, add form elements with rounded borders (border-radius: 5px) in neutral fills.

Testimonials:
“Gemma Exceeded All Expectations! We initially brought Gemma on board for a full
refurbishment of our Skin Clinic, a highly complex project with extremely tight deadlines.
Since we could only close the business for two weeks at a time, efficiency was key. From
day one, Gemma was nothing short of exceptional—professional, solution-focused, and
incredibly organized. No matter the challenge, she found innovative ways to keep the project
on track. Beyond her outstanding project management skills, Gemma’s design expertise
completely transformed our clinic. We receive endless compliments on how stunning the
space looks, and we are certain her design playes a huge role in the business's growth since
the refurbishment. At first, we were hesitant about hiring an interior designer, especially with
the additional fees on top of the renovation costs. However, by the time the project was
complete, we realized that Gemma had actually saved us more money than her fees—
thanks to her exclusive trade discounts and expert sourcing of paint, furniture, and styling
pieces. Not to mention the invaluable time she saved us from having to manage and source
everything ourselves! Our experience was so fantastic that we didn’t hesitate to bring
Gemma back for our home extension. Originally, we had planned to handle the project
ourselves, but after working with her once, we knew we’d never take on another renovation
without her. The extension is absolutely incredible with a different feel from day to night time,
our home now looks like something straight out of a magazine. If you’re considering an
interior designer, we can’t recommend Gemma highly enough. Her expertise, attention to
detail, and ability to bring a vision to life make her worth every penny. Thank you, Gemma,
for making our spaces more beautiful than we ever imagined!”

“Gemma was instructed by an existing client to design and implement her ideas within a
property currently under our management, with the intention of creating a luxury
accommodation type for students. It is clear to see that Gemma’s experience and expertise
have differentiated the property from other student properties within the local area,
something extremely important within such a competitive sector. This in turn has enabled us
to maximise rents, reduce void periods and attract a much better profile of tenant on behalf
of our client. The attention to detail is apparent within the design and finished product,
helping us to create a luxurious, homely feel for the current tenants and provides a stark
contrast to other, more clinical student properties in the local area.”

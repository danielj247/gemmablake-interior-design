            “Gemma exceeded all expectations. We initially brought her on board for a full
            refurbishment of our skin clinic – a highly complex project with extremely tight
            deadlines. Since we could only close the business for two weeks at a time, efficiency
            was key and from day one, Gemma was nothing short of exceptional: professional,
            solution-focussed and incredibly organised.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-brown/85">
            No matter the challenge, she found innovative ways to keep the project on track. Beyond
            her outstanding project management skills, Gemma&rsquo;s design expertise completely
            transformed our clinic. We receive endless compliments on how stunning the space looks,
            and we are certain her design plays a huge role in the business&rsquo;s growth since
            the refurbishment.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-brown/85">
            At first, we were hesitant about hiring an interior designer, especially with the
            additional fees on top of renovation costs. However, by the time the project was
            complete, we realised that Gemma had actually saved us more than her fees – thanks to
            her trade discounts and expert sourcing, as well as the time we saved by not having to
            manage everything ourselves.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-brown/85">
            Our experience was so fantastic that we didn&rsquo;t hesitate to bring Gemma back for
            our home extension. The extension is absolutely incredible, with a different feel from
            day to night – our home now looks like something straight out of a magazine. If
            you&rsquo;re considering an interior designer, we can&rsquo;t recommend Gemma highly
            enough.”

              “It is clear to see that Gemma&rsquo;s experience and expertise have differentiated
              the property from other student properties in the local area – something extremely
              important within such a competitive sector. This has enabled us to maximise rents,
              reduce void periods and attract a much better profile of tenant.”

              “Gemma has an incredible ability to understand how you want your home to feel and to
              translate that into a cohesive design. Every detail feels intentional yet relaxed, and
              the whole process was collaborative, organised and enjoyable from start to finish.”
